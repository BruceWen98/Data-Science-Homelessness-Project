    "This is not a group project. You may discuss the project with other students but you should code and write the report independently. You should acknowledge any help in writing. The score will be based on:\n",

    "-  use of data to back up arguments and analysis quality;  \n",
    "-  insightfulness of the results;\n",

These are Excel files with separate tabs for each year - to make it easier on you, we've aggregated all the years into one file and selected some important columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "We saved the results into files that can be downloaded from Canvas. If some of the columns/data require more information, you can find it in the files available from HUD. Note that not all columns of data were available in all years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should go back to the original datasets and import more data if they are relevant for your analyses.\n",
